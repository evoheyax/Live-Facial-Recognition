This project's goal was to allow for facial recognition from a live camera connected via usb to the computer.

To run, simply start the camera_server.py file.

To add more people to recognize, add another folder with the name in the svm training photos folder, and add 40 pictures of that persons face. That person can now be recognized by the photo.
